# Code4Fun-Space-App

The program can only be run on windows, but of course it can also be run through windows virtual go.
The folder contains two source code files and three compiled executables.
The source code files are about the client and the server respectively, and need to be opened by 易语言(Easy Programming Language, EPL), a programming language from China.
The executable files contain two clients with different user names and one server. Since the files contain functions such as servers designed for network access, some computers may show that the three executables have viruses. The software is safe and you can choose to view the source code if you are not sure.
You have to execute the server program first and then the client program.
